# Chi-square-tests

A chi-square test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The test is used to compare the observed data with the expected data, assuming that there is no significant difference between them. The expected data is calculated based on the null hypothesis, which assumes that there is no significant association between the variables.

Chi-square tests are commonly used in fields such as medicine, sociology, and psychology to analyze data from surveys or experiments. There are different types of chi-square tests, such as the chi-square goodness of fit test, which compares the observed data with the expected data from a particular distribution, and the chi-square test of independence, which compares the observed data from two or more categories.

In a chi-square test, the test statistic is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the observed and expected data, divided by the expected data. This test statistic follows a chi-square distribution, and the p-value obtained from the distribution is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not.

The chi-square test is a powerful tool for analyzing categorical data and can help identify significant associations between variables. However, it does have some limitations, such as the assumption of large sample sizes and the need for categorical data.


Question 1

a) The normal quantile plot is used to check if the returns follow a normal distribution. If the plot shows a straight line, it indicates that the returns are normally distributed.
b) The table groups returns that are less than -0.03 and more than 0.03 to simplify the analysis. Using more categories can make the analysis more complex without adding much value.
c) The chi-squared test of goodness of fit and its p-value can be computed to determine if the returns follow a normal distribution.
d) The chi-squared test and the normal quantile plot should agree with each other if the returns are normally distributed.
e) The advantage of using a normal quantile plot is that it provides a visual representation of the distribution of returns, whereas the chi-squared test provides a quantitative measure of the goodness of fit.

Question 2

a) An appropriate statistical test, such as a chi-squared test or a two-sample t-test, can be used to determine if the trading on some days is better or worse than any other.
b) The test used in (a) compares the observed frequencies of positive returns with the expected frequencies, while comparing the proportion positive for each day with 0.5 assumes that the market is equally likely to go up or down on any given day.
c) The data only indicate the direction of the market, and do not provide information about the magnitude of the returns or the volatility of the market. This limits the conclusions we can draw from the analysis.

Question 4
An appropriate statistical test, such as a two-sample t-test or a chi-squared test, can be used to determine if immigrants' educational attainments differ from those born in the United States. The relevant variables from the GSS2014 data set can be chosen to conduct the analysis.
